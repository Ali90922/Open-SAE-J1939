# Open SAE J1939

SAE J1939 is a protocol for shaping the CAN-bus message in a specific way that suits industrial vehicles such as tractors, machinery, trucks and more.

SAE J1939 is a very easy protocol to use, but there is a lack of information about SAE J1939, due to the cost of the protocol document, available how to shape a CAN-bus message according to SAE J1939 protocol standard. So therefore Iâ€™m writing a SAE J1939 protocol available for free to use on any embedded systems such as STM32, Arduino, AVR, PIC etc or PC.

To learn to build on this project, you need first to understand SAE J1939. I have written this project in `C` language because C is an industry standard. The `C` language dialect I have chosen is `C99` and I don't use dynamical memory allocation in this library. So it will work with `MISRA C` standard.

With this library, you can communicate with valves, engines, actuators, machinery, hardware and all other things that are suitable for heavy industrial mobile applications. I have build up a basic structure of the project and I hope that other users will send pull request of their `C` code for extra functionality to SAE J1939 standard because SAE J1939 is a huge standard. 

# Getting started

The first thing you need to know is to read the document `Open SAE J1939.pdf` inside the `Documentation` folder.
Learn the structure of the project, else you won't be able to understand SAE J1939. 
After you have got a basic understanding of the project, you are able to build on it. Keep it simple and follow the 
SAE J1939 standard!

After you have understand the structure of the project, then select processor choice in `Processor_choice.h` file.
Here you can select for example `STM32`, `Arduino`, `PIC`, `AVR` etc. or if you want to run it on PC first, then select `PROCESSOR_CHOICE 0` and run some examples.
That's the debugging mode for internal CAN feedback.

# How to use the project

 - Step 1: Download this repository
 - Step 2: Go to `Processor_choice.h` and select your processor, if it's not avaiable, please write code for it and send me a pull request
 - Step 3: Copy over the `Src` folder to your project folder inside your IDE. Rename `Src` to for example `Open SAE J1939`. That's a good name.
 - Step 4: Past the header files inside your application code. This is just an example.
 
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "ISO_11783/ISO_11783-7_Application_Layer/Application_Layer.h"
#include "Open_SAE_J1939/Open_SAE_J1939.h"
#include "SAE_J1939/SAE_J1939-71_Application_Layer/Application_Layer.h"
#include "SAE_J1939/SAE_J1939-73_Diagnostics_Layer/Diagnostics_Layer.h"
#include "SAE_J1939/SAE_J1939-81_Network_Management_Layer/Network_Management_Layer.h"
```
 - Step 5: Create the `J1939 j1939 = {0};` inside your application code. You can see inside the examples how I have done
 - Step 6: For every start up, you need to load `uint8_t` data and cast it to the `j1939` struct
 
```c
/* Load J1939 struct */
uint32_t j1939_length = sizeof(J1939);
uint8_t j1939_data[j1939_length];
if(!Load_Struct(j1939_data, j1939_length, J1939_TEXT_FILE_NAME))
	return; /* Problems occurs */
memcpy(&j1939, (J1939*)j1939_data, j1939_length);

/* Delete all addresses by setting them to broadcast address */
memset(j1939.other_ECU_address, 0xFF, 0xFF);

/* Set countings to 0 */
j1939.number_of_cannot_claim_address = 0;
j1939.number_of_other_ECU = 0;

/* If we are going to send and receive the ECU identification and component identification, we need to specify the size of them */
j1939.this_identifications.ecu_identification.length_of_each_field = 30;
j1939.this_identifications.component_identification.length_of_each_field = 30;
j1939.from_other_ecu_identifications.ecu_identification.length_of_each_field = 30;
j1939.from_other_ecu_identifications.component_identification.length_of_each_field = 30;
	
/* This broadcast out this ECU NAME + address to all other ECU:s */
SAE_J1939_Response_Request_Address_Claimed(&j1939);
	
/* This asking all ECU about their NAME + address */
SAE_J1939_Send_Request_Address_Claimed(&j1939, 0xFF);

while(1) {
	/* Read incoming messages */
	Open_SAE_J1939_Listen_For_Messages(&j1939);
	/* Your application code here */
	....
	....
	....
}
```
Now you can use the `Open SAE J1939` library

If you want to rename the `NAME` and address of your ECU

```c
/* Set address for the ECU */
j1939.this_ECU_address = 0x80;
```
Don't forget to look in `SAE J1939 Enums` folder for more predefined fields for `NAME` 
```c
/* Set NAME for the ECU */
j1939.this_name.identity_number = 100;                                          /* From 0 to 2097151 */
j1939.this_name.manufacturer_code = 300;                                        /* From 0 to 2047 */
j1939.this_name.function_instance = 10;                                         /* From 0 to 31 */
j1939.this_name.ECU_instance = 2;                                               /* From 0 to 7 */
j1939.this_name.function = FUNCTION_VDC_MODULE;                                 /* From 0 to 255 */
j1939.this_name.vehicle_system = 100;                                           /* From 0 to 127 */
j1939.this_name.arbitrary_address_capable = 0;                                  /* From 0 to 1 */
j1939.this_name.industry_group = INDUSTRY_GROUP_CONSTRUCTION;                   /* From 0 to 7 */
j1939.this_name.vehicle_system_instance = 10;                                   /* From 0 to 15 */
```

# Questions and answers
 - Q: Can this library be used with `C++`?
 	- A: Yes it can be used with `C++`
 - Q: I want to build on this library, what should I do?
 	- A: First you need to know `C99` and bitwise operations. Then you need to understand the `SAE J1939:21 Transport Layer` structure. Don't forget to update the PDF with your new functionality.
 - Q: Can I use this on my Arduino?
 	- A: Yes, this `C` code is 100% pure `C` code and only using `C` standard library and also the code does not take account of what hardware you are using.
 - Q: Do I need to install the library for to use the library?
 	- A: No, just copy over the `.c` and `.h` files to your project and compile. I have used this with QT framework.
 - Q: This project is quite old now and not so much updates, is it still worth to use it?
 	- A: Yes, this library only updates when I or other includes more functionality from SAE J1939. The reason why I wrote this in `C99` is because it's an industry standard and will you will always be able to compile this library and use it.
 - Q: What is your plan with the library?
 	- A: To make SAE J1939 available for everybody
 - Q: I don't have CAN-bus, but can I use this library anyway with UART, USB, WiFi etc?
 	- A: Yes. This is only a way to shape a massage in a specific way.
 - Q: Can I send data with this library, even if I don't have CAN-bus?
 	- A: Yes. There are something called DM14 transmit request, DM15 status response and DM16 binary transfer. Use that if you want to transfer data in an industrial way.
 	
# Issues and answers

- I: I cannot compile this library. I'm using `Keil Microvision`.
	- A: `Keil Microvision` cannot handle binary numbers such as `0b010101`. Try `STM32CubeIDE` instead because `Open SAE J1939` is made in `STM32CubeIDE`
- I: Can you provide us with some hardware examples for example `STM32`?
	- A: Yes! There is a STM32 example how to get connection with CAN-bus including an interrupt listener for messages. Go to `Examples -> Hardware` folder at look for `CAN_STM32.txt`. Also there is a `USB` example as well for `QT C++`.
